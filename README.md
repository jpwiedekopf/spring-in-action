# Spring In Action, 5th Edition IN KOTLIN

This repository contains an attempt to translate the code examples in Spring in Action, 5th Edition by Craig Walls, published by Manning Publications Co., to Kotlin.

The code is based on the German translation, Spring im Einsatz, 3rd Edition, published by Carl Hanser Verlag.

Some of the code, in particular the Angular implementation of the front-end Single Page Application, was taken from the GitHub repository of the author Craig Walls: https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples and used under the terms of the Apache 2 license.

The author of this repository never used Spring (Boot) before, so he might not be aware of some best practices or easier solutions, so please get in touch. Addionally, tests are somewhat lacking...
